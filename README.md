This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication: silent failures due to invalid credentials or network problems, and potential memory leaks from improperly managed listeners. The `firebaseBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling and listener management.  The solution includes explicit error handling and proper listener removal using `onAuthStateChanged`'s unsubscribe functionality. This ensures a better user experience and prevents resource leaks.
